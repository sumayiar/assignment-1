    Rabbits are small mammals with fluffy, short tails, whiskers, and distinctive long ears. 
    They weigh between 2 to 4 pounds and their fur can come in a variety of colors such as white, brown, black, and grey. 
    As herbivores, their diet primarily consists of grasses, clover, and some leafy weeds. 
    They have a high reproductive rate; females can give birth to multiple litters of babies each year, known as kits.
    Rabbits are social animals, living in groups within complex burrow systems known as warrens. 
    They are also known for their ability to jump and run quickly to escape predators, using their strong hind legs to propel themselves.
