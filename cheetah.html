      Cheetahs are a golden-yellow coat with black spots painted over their body. This helps them camouflage
      in their grassland habitats.

      Their native to sub-Saharan Africa and roam in savannahs, grasslands, scrublands, and semi-arid regions. 
      As carnivores, they hunt medium-sized ungulates such as gazelles and impalas. However, they prefer to
      stay on the ground since they're not the greatest climbers like most cats! Instead, they stalk
      and chase their prey over short distances.

      Unfortunately, they're listed as "Vulnerable" on the International Union for
      Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. They face threats such as
      habitat loss and humans attempting to poach their skins.
