    Koalas are arboreal marsupials native to Australia, recognized by their stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears. 
    Adults weigh about 9 to 33 pounds and have a thick, woolly fur that ranges from grey to brown, with a white underbelly. 
    Primarily nocturnal, koalas feed on eucalyptus leaves, possessing a highly specialized digestive system to detoxify the poisonous compounds in the leaves. 
    Females give birth to one offspring, called a joey, which spends its first six to seven months inside its mother's pouch.
    Koalas are solitary animals, spending most of their time asleep among the branches to conserve energy.
