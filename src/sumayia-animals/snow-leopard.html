      The Snow Leopard is a beautiful, large cut with fur colors ranging from smoky gray to
      yellowish-tan with black rosettes and spotsâ€” helping them camouflage against rocky terrain.
      As carnivores, they have a mighty diet. Their primary prey are mountain ungulates such as 
      ibexes, Himalayan blue sheeps (bharal), and argali sheeps.

      These magnificent large cats native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia, 
      including the Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau, Altai Mountains, and other regions. 

      Unfortunately, snow leopards are listed as "Vulnerable" on the International 
      Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. They face numerous threats,
      including habitat loss, poaching for their fur and body parts, 
      and climate change impacting their mountain habitats.
