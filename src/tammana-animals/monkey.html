        Swinging through sun-dappled canopies, monkeys reign supreme in tropical forests. 
        They are known to be one of the most diverse groups of mammals and about 260 
        species are discovered as of today. Monkeys are found in various habitats including 
        rainforests, savannas, and mountainous regions. These animals typically live for up to 
        15 to 25 years. Monkeys are also one of the species that almost act like humans are very 
        intelligence creatures having the ability to problem solve.
