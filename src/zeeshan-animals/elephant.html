      Elephants are the largest land animals, with adults weighing up to 6 tons and reaching over 10 feet at the shoulder.
      Known for their massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks, they have a gray skin that is thick and wrinkled, helping them to regulate their body temperature. 
      Their diets are herbivorous, consisting mainly of leaves, bark, and fruits, and they are especially partial to the branches of the baobab tree and the marula fruit. 
      Elephants play a crucial role in their ecosystems as keystone species, facilitating the spread of seeds and nutrients, and creating pathways in their environments that other animals can use.
