        Giraffes, the towering monarchs of the savannah, roam the African plains with a gentle majesty. 
        As the tallest mammals on Earth, they stand as living skyscrapers, reaching heights up to 18 feet, their long necks a marvel of nature's design. 
        These giants graze among the treetops, their diet solely composed of leaves, twigs, and fruits, particularly favoring the acacia tree, despite its thorny defenses. 
        Their long, prehensile tongues, colored a dark blue to prevent sunburn, skillfully strip leaves from branches, allowing them to eat with ease.
