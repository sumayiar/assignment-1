        Zebras, the black and white striped equines of Africa, gallop onto the scene with a captivating allure. 
        Three distinct species, Plains, Grevy's, and Mountain, flaunt their bold patterns, each unique as a fingerprint.
         These social grazers roam grasslands and savannas, their stripes offering a fascinating mystery. 
         Theories abound - camouflage against predators, fly-deterrent, even heat regulation - but their true purpose 
         remains an intriguing puzzle. Beyond their mesmerizing coat, zebras boast impressive speed, reaching up to 40 
         mph to outrun hungry lions. These animals live up to up to 20 to 25 years. These animals are herbivores and 
         primarily eat grass and move with their herd to stay protected from their preditors.
