        Flamingoes, the graceful titans of the shallows, strut through tropical wetlands like living bouquets. 
        Standing on one leg like seasoned ballerinas, these long-limbed beauties filter brine shrimp and algae 
        with their elegant, curved beaks, painting the water with a mesmerizing pink hue. These creatures live 
        up to 20 to 30 years. These birds are highly social and often live in larger colonies that can be up to 
        thousands of individuals. Even though these animals are very large they have very strong fliers and are very 
        strong they can cover long distances while migrating and their wings are beautiful colors when they extend.
