      Lions are a marvelous creature, covered in a magnificient mane around their neckâ€” ranging from
      blond to black. They are large carnivorous mammals with muscular bodies and rounded heads. 

      They mainly live in in savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa.
      
      As carnivores, they feed on large mammals such as wildebeests, zebras, buffalo, and antelopes. 
      Fierce as ever, females do most of the hunting, while the males defend the pride's territory and
      offspring. 

      Unfortunately, lions are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of 
      Nature (IUCN). They face various threats, including habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, 
      poaching, and depletion of prey species. Save the lions <a href="https://www.africanparks.org/save-lions">today1</a>
